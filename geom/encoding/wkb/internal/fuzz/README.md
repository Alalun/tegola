# Fuzzing

Fuzzing the wkb package requires go-fuzz: https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz

The first step should be to create the Fuzz program:
`
go-fuzz-build github.com/go-spatial/tegola/geom/encoding/wkb/internal/fuzz
`
This will create a binary called wkb-fuzz.zip in the working directory.

The directory corpus contains sample WKB files generated from the unit test examples and those generated by go-fuzz itself.

To regenerate the corpus:
`
go run gen/main.go -out ./corpus
`
To run the fuzzing function on the corpus:
`
go-fuzz -bin=./wkb-fuzz.zip -workdir=.
`
